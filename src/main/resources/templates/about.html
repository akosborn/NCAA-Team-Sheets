            Quadrantology was created in order to provide easier viewing and access to the quadrant criteria introduced
            by this season as a new way to evaluate teams for the NCAA Tournament. The official team sheets can be found
            <a href="https://extra.ncaa.org/solutions/rpi/SitePages/Home.aspx">here</a> in a PDF. As of now, the RPI calculated here reflects the most-recently-completed day's games.
